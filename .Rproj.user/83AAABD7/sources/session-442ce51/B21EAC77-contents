# Epigenetic Data

## What is epigenetic data?
<br> Epigenetic data arises from "the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence."^[@nora2023] 

Some alterations include:

1. **DNA Methylation**: Addition of methyl groups to DNA, affecting gene expression regulation^[@nora2023].
2. **Histone Modifications**: Chemical changes to histone proteins that DNA wraps around. These changes influence chromatin structure and gene accessibility.^[@allis2015]
3. **Chromatin Accessibility**: Regions of open chromatin that are accessible to transcription factors (a special type of protein invovled in converting DNA to RNA) further dictate which regions of DNA can be expressed^[@melanie2021].

**ATAC-Seq** (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing) and **ChIP-Seq** (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) are common methods used to analyse chromatin accessibility and protein interactions in/with DNA.



## What does epigenetic data look like?

## Sources of epigenetic data


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/opt/homebrew/bin/python3")
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('images/sine_wave.png')
plt.show()
```
