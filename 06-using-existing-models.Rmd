# (PART) Using existing models {-}

# Using gReLU models

Continuing from previous tutorials, the next tutorial similarly uses chIP-Seq data from Encode Experiment [ENCSR817LUF](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR817LUF/){target="_blank"} trained on a gRelu model in order to to predict the coverage levels and examine several of the pitfalls mentioned in section 4. An additional tutorial is included to explain how data was pre-processed for gRelu to explore
